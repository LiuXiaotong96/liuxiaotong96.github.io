## About Me
I am currently a Senior Computer Vision Engineer at XMotors.AI, where I conduct research and develop vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) for self-driving systems and intelligent cabins. Previously, I was a Ph.D. student at the School of Engineering and Applied Science at George Washington University, where I conducted research in the field of computer vision under the guidance of Professor Robert B. Pless. My work focused on providing visual explanations for deep learning models, particularly in the context of deep metric learningâ€”an area with impactful applications such as face re-identification and image retrieval.

Currently, my research explores the application of vision-language models (VLMs) in autonomous driving. I focus on using VLMs and LLMs as decision-making agents to enhance vehicle safety and provide a more comfortable and intelligent in-cabin experience for every passenger.
